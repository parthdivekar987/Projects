# 🎨 Smart Home Control - UI/UX Design Project

This repository contains the complete UI/UX design for a modern, intuitive Smart Home Control application. The project focuses on creating a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to seamlessly manage all their smart devices (lights, thermostats, security, etc.) from a single dashboard.

The entire project was designed and prototyped in **Figma**.

## 💡 Key Design Features

* **🏠 Home Dashboard:** A central hub showing a high-level summary of all connected devices, active scenes, and room statuses.
* **🛋️ Room-Specific Controls:** Dedicated screens for managing devices in specific rooms (e.g., Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen).
* **🎛️ Device Toggles:** Easy-to-use on/off switches, sliders for brightness/temperature, and clear status indicators.
* **🎬 Scene & Automation:** UI for creating, editing, and activating pre-set "scenes" (e.g., "Movie Night," "Good Morning," "Away").
* **📱 Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive, focusing on a mobile-first approach for on-the-go control.
* **🎨 Clean & Modern UI:** A minimalist design focused on clarity, accessibility, and ease of use.

## 🛠️ Design Tools & Methodologies

This project was built entirely using **Figma** and its powerful features. The "technology stack" for this design project includes:

* **Figma (Primary Tool):**
    Used for all stages of the design process, from initial wireframing to the final high-fidelity mockups.

* **Component-Based Design:**
    The design system was built using a robust library of reusable components (buttons, cards, icons, sliders) with variants. This ensures consistency across all screens and makes the design scalable.

* **Auto-Layout & Constraints:**
    Used extensively to create responsive and dynamic components that adapt to different content and screen sizes.

* **Interactive Prototyping:**
    The live demo was created using Figma's built-in prototyping tools to simulate user flow, screen transitions, and micro-interactions.

* **UI/UX Design Principles:**
    The design is grounded in core UX principles (like user control, feedback, and consistency) to ensure a low learning curve and a positive user experience.
